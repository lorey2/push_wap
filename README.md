Here the goal is to sort stacks using the less instructions possible.<br />
If you want to check my alogrythm go look for "truk alogrythm push_swap" on google. <br />
Big shout out to the vizualiser made by a friend here at 42 Lausanne <a href="push.peuf.ch">best visualizer</a><br />
It was difficult but interesting.<br />
TO DO: Redo the project to have 125 (I had 6000 operation when less than 5500 where needed. (and push the corrected code)
